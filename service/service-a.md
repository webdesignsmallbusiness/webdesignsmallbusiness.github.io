More than a third of your customers browse using their smartphones; in fact, it is expected that mobile and tablet browsing could eclipse computer access within three to five years. This very page you're on right now, believe it or not, receives 31 percent of its traffic from smartphones and tablets.

Is your website built with the technology and web design foresight to scale to not only automatically adapt content to a very wide range of screen sizes, but also to dynamically prioritize content and adapt page elements according to the size of the device viewing the web page? Or in other words: Is it responsive design?

It's a fact: 86 percent of smartphone and tablet owners have used their devices to search for information about a business in the last thirty days. How do you reach your audience effectively and ensure their experience with your website regardless of platform or screen size: Through responsive design. 

In web design, [Web Design Small Business UK](/) stopped trying to keep up with new resolutions and endless devices that could possibly your customers accessing your website. Instead, we build websites that adapt and respond to user behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation.Responsive design gives us the freedom to build a site that can dynamically change to suit each user and platform. A media query allows us to target not only certain classes of devices, but also inspect the physical characteristics of the device. We then prioritize content and make strategic decisions about how elements change and how they are repositioned. For example, highlight contact information and social media elements when a user is browsing on a smartphone or adjust text size and readability when a user is on a tablet device.
Mobile first

During a typical responsive design project, designers start with desktop design and then prioritize content across the numerous breakpoints dictated by the thousands of different devices and screen sizes. However, we reverse this process. So instead of porting the desktop version, the content is optimized for smaller screens first (mobile), and if needed, the site can be gradually upgraded for larger platforms with fewer limitations. Think "progressive enhancement" rather than "graceful degradation."
