I"≥<p>Social media marketing refers to the process of obtaining traffic or attention through social networking sites.
Social media itself is a general term for sites that can provide radically different social actions. For example, Twitter is a social site designed for people to share short messages or ‚Äúupdates‚Äù with others. Facebook, on the other hand is a full-fledged social networking site that allows for the sharing of updates, photos, joining events and a variety of other activities.
Social media often feeds into the discovery of new content, such as news, and ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù is a search activity. Social media can also help build links which in turn helps SEO efforts. Many people also search social media sites to find social media content. Social connections can also affect the relevance of some search results, either within a social media network or in a ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù search engine.
